<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

Two solutions implemented. 

In the first one, I tried a top down approach starting from the length of the stirng s and testing all possibilities of palindrome from largest to smallest. It works, but I thought it would find the solution quickly, but it is still testing all the possibilities in the worst case. And it uses a is_palindrome function, which is O(n). 

In the second one, I tried to start from a central letter and scan to the left and to the right looking for the largest palindrome. It doesn't use a palindrome verification function, so it is faster.
